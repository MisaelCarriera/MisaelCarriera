My name is Misael Carriera ,I am currently learning Flask Micro-framework on Codecademy following my Python. certification. I have also earned my HTML and CSS certification that I acquired through FreeCodeCamp. In my current occupation, I am a Utility Attendant at a Target warehouse where I assist technicians with minor adjustments and improvements to the facility while using powered hand tools and equipment throughout the warehouse. I have obtained many of my skills throughout years of both work and life experiences and I am prepared to learn more as I continue through life.
